        <p> 
            My name is Nathan Hammer and I am from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
            I am currently pursuing a B.A. in Digital Media, Arts, and Technology @ Penn State Behrend.
            Most of my work revolves around programming, web design, game development, and server management.

            I have always been curious about the inner-workings of computers and video games.
            At a young age, I taught myself how to make levels for Source engine games, like Team Fortress 2 . 
            It sparked my passion for games that synergize creativity and mechanical design. 
            Later, I started to experiment with game servers and mods, developing an understanding of server infrastructure and programming. 
            Whenever I have the free time, I like to work on game prototypes or engage with spontaneous coding challenges.

            I am always exercising my skill set -- in and outside of school.
            There is never a moment where I am not learning and applying new concepts.
