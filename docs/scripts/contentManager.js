        <p> 
            My name is Nate Hammer and I am from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
            I am currently pursuing a <b>B.A. in Digital Media, Arts, and Technology @ Penn State Behrend</b>, along with <b>minors in Game Development and Marketing</b>.
            Most of my work revolves around programming, web design, game development, and server management.
        </p>

            I have always been curious about the inner-workings of computers and video games.
            At a young age, I taught myself how to make Team Fortress 2 levels, which sparked a passion for software that synergizes artistry with mechanical design.
            This lead to me dabbling into programming, so that I could create games of my own.
            Later, I started to experiment with Linux servers, developing an understanding of network infrastructure and security.
            Now, here I am, studying all of these things in college. Whenever I have the free time, I like to work on game prototypes or engage in spontaneous coding challenges.
        </p>

            I am always exercising my skill set -- in and outside of school.
            There is never a moment where I am not learning and applying new concepts.
